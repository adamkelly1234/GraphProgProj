This project is a game conisting of a hero that captures monsters.

Project folder tree structure:
This project consists in a file called 'project.html' where all the
game logic resides and a subdirectory called 'images' where the
background and sprites of the game are.

Game Objective:
The hero has to capture all the monsters in a level without getting caught by the White devil.

This game has infinite levels.
This game ends when the hero is caught by the White devil.

Game Instructions:

web browser.

The player can start a new session by clicking in the text:
